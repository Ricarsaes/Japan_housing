# Appendix ðŸ“‚

This folder contains notebooks related to predictive models and advanced analysis. Below is a description of each notebook and its purpose:

## Folder Contents

### 1. `chubu_mean_impute.ipynb`, `Hokkaido.ipynb`, `Tohoku.ipynb`, `Tokyo.ipynb`
These notebooks include:
- Predictive models segmented by region in Japan.
- The result models are the following folders: models, modelsKNN, best_models, imputer_models

### 2. `Model_prefectures_with_validation.ipynb`
This notebook includes:
- Execution of models using Time-Series cross-validation techniques.
- Evaluation of key performance metrics.
- However, the code failed executing at 80% completion (3 hours in) and ran out of time to re-launch


## Additional Notes
- The resulting models will be available at an external link as I don't cosider good practices putting these files in a repository.
